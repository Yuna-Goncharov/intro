those classes could be divided into two groups, one implements a color and image
and the second groups implements some functions on real numbers.

README                   This file.

---color and image classes
    RGBColor.java            This class represents a color.
    RGBImage.java            This class represents a 2D color image, composed of RGB pixels.

---functions on real numbers
    RealFunction.java        An interface that represents classes that are real valued functions.
    LinearFunction.java      This class implements a linear function as RealFunction.
    QuadraticFunction.java   This class represents a Quadratic function of the form a*(x^2).
    SineFunction.java        This class represents a sine Function.
    CosineFunction.java      This class represents a Cosine Function.
    SumFunctions.java        This class represents a RealFunction that is the sum of the other real functions.
    CompositeFunction.java   This class represents a RealFunction that is the composition of the two functions.
    DerivativeFunction.java  This class represents a RealFunction that is the derivative of an other real function.
    FunctionGraphics.java    This class graphically plots objects that implement the RealFunction interface.

i used my RGBColor and RGBImage from previous weeks.
